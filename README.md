This dataset contains 15 folders of images of size (224X224X3) suitable for image classification. Each folder represents a class corresponding to the folder name. Images are downloaded from the web and preprocessed(resized and augmented) using OpenCV libraries. Therefore, this dataset can directly be used in training without further data augmentation.
